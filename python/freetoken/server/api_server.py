              page_size for KV and num_experts for MoE, both known here, and 0 for mamba).
      max -- the ideal-case unit count if the whole cache budget went to this one pool:
                  max = pool_budget // unit_cost,
              where pool_budget is ``cache_budget_bytes`` -- the SAME ceiling the rebuild
              fit-check enforces (memory_ratio x pre-model baseline − weights), so a slider can

              measured before any pool existed, so each pool's ideal max is simply budget/cost
              -- no current-occupancy correction -- and the bounds are stable across rebuilds.

              Still optimistic in one way: it is the ``fixed=0`` whole-cache ceiling, while a

              carries those may still be rejected; the desktop's whole-config budget line is
              what catches that.

              MoE is additionally capped at the model's own routed-expert count: past that the
              budget could buy slots the model has nothing to put in.

    A pool whose unit cost or the budget signal is unknown (0) reports max 0 -- the desktop
    reads that as "unknown" and keeps its own bounds. Non-MoE / non-hybrid models therefore

    The shell is an ordinary API client (see ``freetoken.shell``), so shell mode is just
    ``ft serve`` plus that client -- one generation path for every caller, none of it
    shell-private. uvicorn owns the HTTP surface on a worker thread and, through its lifespan,
    the orderly shutdown that flags ``_SHUTTING_DOWN`` before the workers exit; the main thread
    belongs to the TUI. Access logging is off because those lines would land in the middle of
    the chat as it streams -- ``/v1/requests`` still records every request for ``ft ctl``.

    Signals: uvicorn's capture is a no-op off the main thread, so ^C stays with the shell, which
    binds it to "cancel this turn". That only works because the engine workers leave our process
    group in shell mode (launch.py:_detach_process_group) -- otherwise the terminal would deliver
    that same ^C to them and the shell would go on chatting with a dead engine. In exchange, the
    stop signals they no longer receive are relayed by _install_shell_stop_handlers below."""
