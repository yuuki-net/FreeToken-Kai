"""Checkpoint-loading entry points, routed per model architecture.

Each loader resolves the model spec from the checkpoint config and dispatches to the
model module (``models/<name>/weight.py``). Passing ``dummy=True`` replaces the
checkpoint read with randomly filled tensors that keep the loader's exact output
contract (shapes, dtypes, pinning), so everything downstream — repack, offload cache,
kernels — runs unchanged without weights on disk. A model whose banks differ from the
default layout opts out by defining the same-named ``dummy_*`` hook in its weight
module; otherwise the defaults below (built purely from the parsed config) apply.
