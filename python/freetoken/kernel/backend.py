"""Availability probes for the optional native kernel packages.

When flashinfer / sgl_kernel are installed the call-sites use their fused CUDA
ops; otherwise they fall back to the pure-Triton kernels in
``freetoken.kernel.triton``. ``find_spec`` only checks that the package is
importable (no import side effects), and the result is cached.
