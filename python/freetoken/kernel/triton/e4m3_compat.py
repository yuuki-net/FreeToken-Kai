"""e4m3 (fp8e4nv) emulation for pre-sm_89 CUDA GPUs.

Triton rejects the fp8e4nv type anywhere in a kernel compiled for sm < 89 -- the
check sits in ``dtype.to_ir``, so even an fp8 *pointer argument* is illegal.
Affected kernels branch on :func:`e4m3_native_cx` (a compile-time constexpr): the
native branch stays byte-identical on sm_89+, the emulated branch is dead-code
eliminated there. When the emulated branch is active, wrappers must pass e4m3
tensors as ``.view(torch.uint8)`` and allocate act-quant outputs as bf16 -- use
the host-side twin :func:`e4m3_native` for those decisions.

``FREETOKEN_FORCE_E4M3_EMU=1`` (or true/yes/on) forces the emulated path on any
GPU (for A/B validation against the native fp8 unit). The flag is read ONCE at
import and is deliberately NOT part of triton's compilation cache key, so:
flipping it later in the same process raises (see :func:`e4m3_native`), and when
it is set without an explicit ``TRITON_CACHE_DIR`` the default cache dir is
salted so a warm native cache can never serve the other branch's binary for the
signature-invariant kernels (``_act_quant_inplace_kernel``).

The primitives are validated bit-exact against the native fp8 unit on H100 (all
254 non-NaN codes; 2.1M adversarial rounding samples covering every grid
midpoint, the subnormal range and the 2^-6 boundary). Known deviations: the NaN
codes 0x7F/0xFF decode to +-480 (checkpoints never store NaN weights), and
``round_e4m3(-0.0)`` returns +0.0.
